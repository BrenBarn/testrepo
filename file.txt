Here is a basic file.

Now I'm going hog-wild.
I'm adding lines all over the place.

I added this line after pushing a different change.

I changed this line when I added file2.

This change was made in the clone.

I'm trying to do a branch.

I even added a line way down here!

I added another line.  I changed it in the clone.  I made this change after pushing a different change.
